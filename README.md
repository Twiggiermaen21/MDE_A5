Assignment A5 (Transformations)

Task 1
Apply different refactory operations on the metamodel defined in the A4 to create an updated version. Those refinements should include:
Deletion and addition of concepts,
Concept renaming,
Structural refinements, for instance:
Adding/removing hierarchies,
adding/removing structural features (i.e., attributes and references)
Change attribute
In our vision, the refining steps should make it easy for you to implement task 3. At this stage, we will evaluate the complexity of the refining steps.

Task 2
Define an M2M transformation that allows the migration of models conforming to the initial metamodel version to the one refined in task 1. For this task, use ATL.

Task 3
Define an M2T transformation that generates informative HTML pages for a given domain. By resembling the demo implemented during the lectures, the M2T should generate at least an index page summarizing the model elements linked to informative details pages for the modeled concepts.
For this task, use Acceleo.
